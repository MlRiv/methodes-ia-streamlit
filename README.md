# Neural ODEs Application

This application showcases the use of Neural ODEs  to simulate and model various scenarios. There are currently three applications available:

## Bouncing Ball
The Bouncing Ball application models the motion of a ball bouncing on a surface with various physical parameters. 

## Shape 
The Shape application allows users to compare the fit of a Neural ODE to a ResNet on several shapes.

## SIR Model
The SIR Model application simulates the spread of a disease through a population using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. Users can observe how the disease spreads over time.

# Installation
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the app by typing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.

3. Once the app is running, you can create and modify shapes using the interface.
