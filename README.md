# Neural ODEs Application

This application showcases the use of Neural ODEs  to simulate and model various scenarios. There are currently three applications available:

## Bouncing Ball
The Bouncing Ball application models the motion of a ball bouncing on a surface with various physical parameters. 

## Shape 
The Shape application allows users to compare the fit of a Neural ODE to a ResNet on several shapes.

## SIR Model
The SIR Model application simulates the spread of a disease through a population using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. Users can observe how the disease spreads over time.

# Installation
To install the necessary modules for the proper functioning of the application, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt at the root of the project:
streamlit run app.py
The application will automatically open in your default browser.
